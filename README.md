# CS1C-Exam2
Write a program that models several different types of Vehicles. The vehicles we want to support are Cars, Motorcycles, Boats, and Planes. Each vehicle has a type (e.g. "car", "motorcycle").

 

Each vehicle has:

1) a unique identifier or VIN (not modifiable after creation)

2) color (modifiable at any time)

3) manufacturer (not modifiable after creation)

4) year (not modifiable after creation)

 

Every vehicle can be started, stopped, and move forward. Only some vehicles (cars, motorcycles) can move backward.

 

You can print vehicles by calling cout << myVehicle. Print all the properties of the vehicle mentioned above.

 

You should be able to compare vehicles using the following:

1. override operator == 

2. override operator !=

 

For the equals operator, make sure all 4 of the fields match.

 

Submission:

1. All .h and .cpp files

2. A main.cpp to demonstrate your program working

3. An output.txt file with your program output.
